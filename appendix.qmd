# Appendix

This appendix documents the outputs generated with a Large Language Model (ChatGPT) during the creation of my multi-page MBA portfolio website.  
All AI-generated content is clearly identified, and my annotations explain how I revised and personalized it to ensure authenticity.

## LLM-Generated Site Map (Initial Draft)

**ChatGPT Output:**  
- Home/About  
- Resume or CV  
- Projects/Case Studies  
- Skills & Certifications  
- Contact  

**My Revision:**  
I kept this overall structure but expanded the “Projects” page with detailed case studies and references. I also added UCW branding (logo, background image) and an embedded map to personalize the site.

## LLM-Generated About Me (Draft)

**ChatGPT Output (excerpt):**  
“I’m Jordan Lee, an MBA candidate specializing in Business Analytics at University Canada West. My interests lie at the intersection of AI, strategy, and digital transformation.”

**My Revision:**  
I replaced the sample name “Jordan Lee” with my fictional identity “Abhilash” and expanded the section with my own academic journey, internship highlights, and specific UCW coursework. I also added a UCW Administration building background image for visual context.

## LLM-Generated Resume (Draft)

**ChatGPT Output:**  
Provided a generic resume structure with placeholders for education, experience, skills, and certifications.  

**My Revision:**  
I filled in details from my fictional academic path (UCW BSc and MBA) and added realistic experiences (FutureTech AI Solutions internship, BrightSpark Retail analyst role). I also generated a downloadable PDF resume using Quarto and linked it on the site.

## LLM-Generated Projects Section (Draft)

**ChatGPT Output:**  
Suggested projects such as “Customer Segmentation with ML” and “Retail Analytics Dashboard” without details.  

**My Revision:**  
I expanded each project with:  
- **Customer Segmentation:** Detailed use of K-means clustering, inserted image `k_means.jpg`, and cited the dataset source (Project Gurukul, 2023).  
- **Retail Analytics Dashboard:** Added context on Power BI dashboard design and included Microsoft Learn (2024) as an APA reference with an illustrative screenshot (`power-bi-dashboard.png`).  
- **Case Competition:** Added specifics about AI-driven supply chain optimization.  
- **Independent Research:** Linked to BUSI 654 coursework.

## LLM-Generated Contact Section (Draft)

**ChatGPT Output:**  
Basic email and LinkedIn links.  

**My Revision:**  
I expanded this section to include GitHub, a downloadable resume, and an embedded Google Maps iframe showing the UCW campus location.
