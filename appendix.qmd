# 3. Reflection & Commentary

I used ChatGPT to generate a structural outline and draft sample for my MBA portfolio assignment. This helped me brainstorm an efficient layout and content organization. I chose to keep the overall headings and general format but rewrote all the content using a fictional persona "Alex Morgan," an MBA student enrolled in BUSI 654.

I modified company names, academic experiences, tools (like Power BI, GPT APIs), and tone to match a student working with AI applications in business. All content was checked for originality, tone, and accuracy. The Markdown formatting and Quarto rendering options were also adjusted for GitHub Pages compatibility.
