    "text": "About Me\nIâ€™m Abhilash, an MBA candidate at University Canada West (UCW) specializing in Business Analytics.\nMy academic journey is focused on leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and data-driven insights to solve complex business challenges. Through my coursework in BUSI 654 â€“ Application of AI in Business and related electives, I have developed a strong foundation in areas such as machine learning, predictive analytics, and digital transformation.\nMy professional interests lie at the intersection of AI applications in business, strategic decision-making, and organizational innovation. I am especially interested in investigating the potential of advanced analytics and emerging artificial intelligence technologies, including GPT-driven assistants and automation platforms, to enhance customer experiences, optimize operations and contribute to businesses across industries their sustainable growth.\nI have used my abilities in internships and as an employee, which is beyond academics. Indicatively, as an intern at FutureTech AI Solutions, I participated in the deployment of chatbots and customer segmentation projects where I could observe how AI technologies can alter customer interaction. These experiences supported my interests in formulating strategies that incorporate technical abilities and real business requirements to the world.\nThis website is a comprehensive digital portfolio that presents my academic achievements, my professional background, and my choice of projects. It is an expression of what I have learned so far and where I want to go as I go through my MBA program. I would be glad to see you visit my piece and check my projects and get in touch with me regarding possible cooperation or professional activities."

    "text": "During my internship at FutureTech AI Solutions, I developed a predictive model to segment customers based on their demographics and purchasing behaviors. The project involved applying K-means clustering, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to group customers into clusters with similar characteristics.\nFor example, clusters were identified based on age, annual income, and spending score, enabling the business to design more personalized marketing strategies. By analyzing these segments, the marketing team was able to target promotions more effectively, leading to a measurable improvement in customer retention.\n\n\nK-means clustering works by dividing data into k clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest centroid (average position). The algorithm follows these steps:\n1. Select the number of clusters (k).\n2. Randomly initialize centroids from the dataset.\n3. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.\n4. Update centroids by recalculating the mean of assigned points.\n5. Repeat until centroids stabilize and cluster assignments stop changing.\nThis iterative process ensures that customers are grouped into meaningful, data-driven clusters that can be acted upon by business leaders (Project Gurukul, 2023).\nHere is a simple visualization of the clustering process: \nhttps://projectgurukul.org/customer-segmentation-project-machine-learning/\n\n\n\n\n\nAt BrightSpark Retail, I designed and implemented an interactive Power BI dashboard that consolidated sales and inventory data from five regional stores into a single, dynamic view. This dashboard helped leadership monitor KPIs such as sales performance, stock levels, and regional comparisons in near real-time. By automating previously manual reporting processes, the dashboard reduced inefficiencies and improved the timeliness of decision-making.\n\n\nAccording to Microsoft (2024), a Power BI dashboard is a single-page canvas that tells a data story through visualizations, often called tiles. Each tile represents a visualization pinned from a report, and users can click through tiles to explore deeper insights. Unlike full reports, dashboards are designed to highlight only the most important information, enabling decision-makers to quickly grasp key performance trends.\nThis design philosophy influenced my project: I prioritized clarity and brevity by selecting only the most actionable metrics. For example, store managers could see sales by region, top-selling products, and low-inventory alerts at a glance, with the option to drill down into detailed reports when needed (Microsoft, 2024).\nHere is an example visualization of a Power BI dashboard layout:\n https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/service-dashboards\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of a finalist team, I designed an AI-driven expansion strategy for a multinational retailer entering new markets. My role included analyzing supply chain constraints and simulating demand forecasts with machine learning models. The experience sharpened my teamwork and presentation skills.\n\n\n\n\nIn BUSI 654, I did a research paper on the adoption of generative AI tools in corporate strategy. The paper explored how organizations can balance innovation with ethical considerations, a topic I plan to expand on for future academic or industry publication."
