# My Projects & Case Studies

## Customer Segmentation with Machine Learning
During my internship at FutureTech AI Solutions, I developed a predictive model to segment customers based on their demographics and purchasing behaviors. The project involved applying **K-means clustering**, an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to group customers into clusters with similar characteristics. 

For example, clusters were identified based on **age, annual income, and spending score**, enabling the business to design more personalized marketing strategies. By analyzing these segments, the marketing team was able to target promotions more effectively, leading to a measurable improvement in customer retention.

### About K-means Clustering
K-means clustering works by dividing data into *k* clusters, where each data point belongs to the cluster with the nearest centroid (average position). The algorithm follows these steps:  
1. Select the number of clusters (*k*).  
2. Randomly initialize centroids from the dataset.  
3. Assign each data point to the nearest centroid.  
4. Update centroids by recalculating the mean of assigned points.  
5. Repeat until centroids stabilize and cluster assignments stop changing.  

This iterative process ensures that customers are grouped into meaningful, data-driven clusters that can be acted upon by business leaders (Project Gurukul, 2023).  

Here is a simple visualization of the clustering process:

## Retail Analytics Dashboard
At **BrightSpark Retail**, I designed and implemented an **interactive Power BI dashboard** that consolidated sales and inventory data from five regional stores into a single, dynamic view. This dashboard helped leadership monitor KPIs such as sales performance, stock levels, and regional comparisons in near real-time. By automating previously manual reporting processes, the dashboard reduced inefficiencies and improved the timeliness of decision-making.

### About Power BI Dashboards
According to Microsoft (2024), a **Power BI dashboard** is a single-page canvas that tells a data story through visualizations, often called tiles. Each tile represents a visualization pinned from a report, and users can click through tiles to explore deeper insights. Unlike full reports, dashboards are designed to highlight only the most important information, enabling decision-makers to quickly grasp key performance trends.  

This design philosophy influenced my project: I prioritized clarity and brevity by selecting only the most actionable metrics. For example, store managers could see **sales by region**, **top-selling products**, and **low-inventory alerts** at a glance, with the option to drill down into detailed reports when needed (Microsoft, 2024).  

Here is an example visualization of a Power BI dashboard layout:

## UCW 2025 Case Competition
As part of a finalist team, I designed an AI-driven expansion strategy for a multinational retailer entering new markets. My role included analyzing supply chain constraints and simulating demand forecasts with machine learning models. The experience sharpened my teamwork and presentation skills.

## Independent Research: AI in Business Strategy
In BUSI 654, I did a research paper on the adoption of generative AI tools in corporate strategy. The paper explored how organizations can balance innovation with ethical considerations, a topic I plan to expand on for future academic or industry publication.
